      <description>&lt;p&gt;The main motivation behind the club&amp;rsquo;s formation is to create a welcoming community of students with similar interests in the martial art, particularly karate, to come together and form bonds between them and see the club as a second home and be a part of a new family. Going into Politeknik Brunei (PB) I miss that sense of community I&amp;rsquo;ve previously experienced with friends whom I met throughout my time actively attending karate training in school and I wish for the students of PB to be able to seek the same experience I now cherished. This is my gift for them.
The start was rough, when the club has just been established we were going through the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and students were expected to study from home and quarantine. Club activities had to be postponed for the safety of everyone. Virtual trainings were eventually carried out with the help of the club&amp;rsquo;s instructor to keep club activities running and when it&amp;rsquo;s time to finally go back to training, it was already at the end of the semester.
By July of 2022, club activities once again resumed with more participations from the new intake with news of a tournament fast approaching. It was the Under-21 Interscheme Karate Tournament hosted by Jabatan Belia dan Sukan which turned out to be a very successful first tournament participation for PB Karate Club. A total of 3 gold medals, 4 silver medals and 6 bronze medals were attained throughout the 3-day event at Pusat Belia.

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

It was one of my biggest wishes as the club&amp;rsquo;s founder to have PB participate in a tournament regardless of the results but the results were more than what I could&amp;rsquo;ve asked for, everyone did their best and demonstrated strong karate spirit.
My hope for the club moving forward is to embody the sense of togetherness that has been established in our little community despite of everyone&amp;rsquo;s different backgrounds whether they have trained previously or are completely new, everyone is most welcomed! And my hope for the new club committee members is to take good care of the club as much as I personally have throughout my time in Politeknik Brunei.&lt;/p&gt;
